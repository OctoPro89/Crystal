    <h1>Crystal 3D (Alpha)</h1>
    <h3>Crystal 3D is my secondary project. Currently, Crystal 3D is private and I don't currently intend on making it public.</h3>
    <h3>Although, I may eventually have a Patreon where Patrons can access Crystal 3D so if you are interested that may be coming.</h3>
    <h3>It is very much still in it's early stage, and things like animations are being added.</h3>
    <h3>The docs are <a class="link" href="Docs.html">here</a>. If you want to support me, please subscribe to me on youtube with the link above.</h3>
    <h3>When Crystal (3D and 2D) is polished, I will make a game with him that will be available on Steam.</h3>
